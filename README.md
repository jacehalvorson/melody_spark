# Melody Spark (deprecated)
Check out the new version of the project (built using Flutter). https://github.com/jacehalvorson/guitar_buddy

## Vision
A powerful tool for guitar players who want to craft captivating melodies. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced musician, this app will guide you in creating melodies that perfectly complement your chosen background track.

Not only will this guide you in creating melodies, but it will also teach you about the notes on a guitar and the relationships between them. This is the primary motivation behind the app because I can't play very well and I want to improve.
### Input - Backing Track Chords
Initially this will be a list of chords e.g. ["G", "Em", "C"] but it could also be detected from audio or web scraped from Ultimate Guitar based on a song name.

### Output - Arpeggios
A list of notes (represented as highlighted dots on the screen fretboard) that complement the current chord in the backing track. This will change for each chord transition.

### UI - Visualization of Fretboard
This will be tricky to fit on a phone screen, some form of scrolling will likely be required.

## Additional Features Desired
- Backing track loop to play over
- Playback speed adjustment
- Indication of chord suspense/resolution
- Videos showing how to use the app and giving tips

## Why It Failed
Frustration with React Native grew as my code turned into spaghetti. I lost motivation for the project as it became less enjoyable to work on. Even if I saw it through to the end, it wouldn't be supported on multiple platforms so I decided it's time to take what I learned and start fresh. This gives me a chance to learn a new language and framework (Flutter and Dart) as well.
